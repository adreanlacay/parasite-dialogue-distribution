# _Parasite_: Dialogue Distribution

Since its release in 2019, _Parasite_ has become one of my all-time favourite films. Bong Joon-ho's work has received critical acclaim, and amassed countless awards and nominations, including the Oscars. However, no one on the cast was nominated for Best Actor or Actress. On the other hand, determining one actor/actress to represent the film and the category can be difficult due to their roles in the story. Using an English-translated script and R, I gathered the word and line counts of the Kim family to help decide which performance would have selected for the Best Actor/Actress category, if they were to have been nominated.

## Technology and Software

The code was written and compiled on RStudio (ver. 2022.12.0+353).

## Required Packages

To run the code, users must have the following packages in RStudio:
* tidyverse (or stringr)
* pdftools

## Results

After gathering the information and visualizing it on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adrean.lacay/viz/Parasite-DialogueDistribution/Parasite), these were the corresponding outputs:

Family Member | Page Count | Line Count | Word Count
--- | --- | --- | ---
Ki-Tek | 53 | 138 | 1778
Chung-Sook | 93 | 283 | 772
Ki-Woo | 66 | 184 | 1855
Ki-Jung | 45 | 92 | 822

As we see here, the family member with the most lines and words was Ki-Woo. Therefore, if _Parasite_ were have had a representative for the Best Actor or Actress category at the Oscars, Choi Woo-shik would have been chosen. Regardless of the Academy's decision, the film still received four Oscars, including Best Director and Best Picture. More importantly, _Parasite_ put a spotlight on Korean/Asian cinema and has helped bring its culture to the mainstream.
